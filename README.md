# Data-Visualization_NBAShotLogs-2015
**Data Visualisation project on NBA 2015 shot logs. Made in Java Script using D3 and Vegalite.**

## Description
This project has been coded from scratch and is described in the pdf file Explanation. In order to better enjoy the interactivity of the simulation I recommend you to test it.

## Usage
In oder to interact with visualisation I recommend to use Live Server Plugin available in many code editors (Atom, VSCode...). Launch the visualisation from the .html file. Data can be downloaded <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs'> here </a>.

## Short Tutorial
You can swap the point of view (made <--> success) for basketball field and charts representation 
at any time by pressing ENTER. Please just make sure that the data has been loaded entirely and that graphs are
up to date to press ENTER and switch again. (You can't switch view using the select on the bot of the visualization
this only indicates what is your current view)

You can select the time left in the attack phase for the visualisation by puting an integer (should be an integer)
in the field Time left on the attack. When you have made this click on the basketball field to unslect the field 
where you type your integer and from now you can press ESCAPE to update the visualisation.

A tooltip has been added to bar charts to better see and identify a certain value of the bar chart.
