This is a short tutorial on how to use the visualization.

You can swap the point of view (made <--> success) for basketball field and charts representation 
at any time by pressing ENTER. Please just make that all the data has been loeaded and that graphs are
up to date to press ENTER and switch again. (You can't switch view using the select on the bot of the visualization
this only indicates what is your current view)

You can select the time left in the attack phase for the visualisation by puting an integer (should be an integer)
in the field Time left on the attack. When you have made this click on the basketball field to unslect the field 
where you type your integer and from now you can press ESCAPE to update the visualisation.

A tooltip has been added to bar charts to better see and identify a certain value of the bar chart.
